I ordered a LandRover 21 plate but then became concerned that this was not the updated model and so rang cinch for some clarification. However, due to the long hours I work I asked my husband to do this for me however he was promised a call back but it never came. I therefore phoned them and the guy was unable to help me but promised a call back but it never came. I was anxious and so my husband drove to our local LandRover dealership and they confirmed from the pictures it was the older model. I therefore made the decision to cancel the order and purchase another LandRover with Cinch despite my reservations. I thought perhaps it was just bad luck given other reviews, I ordered my LandRover and fully financed this on 19th April 24 and then rang cinch about questions relating to the original vehicle I was going to purchase.

Absolutely stay away from this company DO NOT buy a car from them under any circumstances. We bought a car from them back in September. They gave us a date and location to pick it up, my husband arrived but there was no one and no car! My husband had to call Cinch who then informed us that they had actually damaged our car in transit and someone should have emailed us to let us know...they didn't! We had to chase them up for a further 3 weeks then eventually they dropped our car off at our house. We have also had an ongoing issue with an engine fault/emissions failure. EVERY few weeks the same fault has appeared! We have been fobbed off numerous times and Cinch are incapable of doing anything quicker than Sloth pace! First time, They sent their mechanic out to the house to 'fix' the issue. It didn't fix it! 6 weeks later same issue. Second time, they sent their mechanic out to 'fix' the issue. The mechanic told us that if it happened again it was to go directly to a Peugeot garage to have the part replaced. 3 weeks later the SAME issue. We called Cinch they couldn't get us booked in for 6 weeks but the issue was that everytime this emissions fault light came on it gave a count down from 700 miles and if we used it over 700 miles the car would not restart. So waiting 6 weeks wasn't good enough. They eventually got us booked in to a garage an hour away from our house for 3 weeks time. My husband took it on the Friday they said they ran a diagnostic, there was nothing wrong with it, reset the engine light and gave it back. 2 days later THE SAME fault! They got it booked back in to the same garage 2 weeks later this time they said it needed a new catalytic converter then all issues would be resolved! I took it on Thursday waited 6 hours while they did it and the very NEXT day...the engine fault light came back on. The car got booked in yesterday to another garage and they have now told us it's a completely different part that needs replaced but the car is not safe and we cannot have it back till they get the part which is out of stock till the end of May! In the meantime I have three children that I need a car to get to appointments and classes etc as I cannot constantly afford taxis, trains and buses and Cinch have said we may not even get a courtesy car.

He decided not to take the car. I then called Motorway and asked what my options were. After a couple of calls I was told that the dealer pulled out of the deal as it had an electrical fault which it does not. I explained the reason why he did not really take the car but the only way they would advertise the car again is if I took the car to an auto electrician and get a full report off them. The person I spoke to would not listen to me when I advised that the dealer was using the electrical fault as an excuse and the car is fault free.

It's disheartening to contrast the exceptional quality of the car with the disappointing aftercare experience.

It took a little longer than expected for the buying dealer to come to my address and look at the vehicle but never mind. I was not daft enough to not expect a little attempt at the buying dealer to try and negotiate slightly even though I had appraised the vehicle correctly on the motorway system. I would say the car was a 9.5 out of 10. I had a couple of wheel refurbishments done and a new windscreen under the cars insurance to avoid as much negotiation as possible. My girlfriend was subjected to a ¬£1500 price reduction on collection. I could have lived with ¬£100 maybe even ¬£150, but they were trying to take the mick. So I reattempted to sell through motorway again this time making sure everything was noted down even marks as small as a dot on a piece of paper were declared. It again sold, this time for less money. I wasn‚Äôt best pleased but was happy to move on and get it sorted. Two weeks on from selling for a 2nd time and motorway ‚Äúcannot get in touch‚Äù with the buyer as they are not responding to them. I have been made aware on a couple of occasions that the buyer (BIG Motoring world, aka BIG waste of time) buy hundreds of cars from Motorway each month. Heaven knows why they won‚Äôt respond to Motorway regarding this purchase. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case but I‚Äôll never get to know why. They suggested contacting the 2nd highest bidder and once again (after a few more days have passed) can‚Äôt obtain contact with these people either. It‚Äôs safe to say my experience with Motorway had been disastrous. I would not consider using Motorway ever again. I had to chase things repeatedly and was told ‚Äúok leave it with me we will call you back‚Äù.  Not once did they call me back. If you are looking to use motorway rather than part exchange my advice is try and get a good price with the dealer, Motorway isn‚Äôt all it‚Äôs cracked up to be. Yes the price they say looks great but let me tell you it‚Äôs not been worth the hassle.

Ordered a Tesla online, 2 days before delivery was told there was a mechanical issue so would need a few days to sort.

Rang every day trying to find out more information, the customer service team ranged from trying to be helpful to downright rude. Either way they were never able to help as they don‚Äôt have communications with the ‚Äúservice‚Äù team - just a messaging service, and the service team never update the system. The following week I was told the car was at Tesla to have the previous owner removed (factory reset - this takes about 2 minutes‚Ä¶). Again, rang every day for updates, was never able to be given an expected completion date or delivery date. The next week told the car was going to Tesla at the end of the week - hang on, I thought it was already there?! But still not able to give me an exact day or delivery date. End of the week they don‚Äôt know where the car is or the state of the fix. Finally offered a bit of money off and a hire car. But wait, the finance offer has now expired (21 days). So finance will be cancelled, this takes 10 days to wind down, at which point they very kindly said I would be able to repurchase the car and apply for finance again. I get the email that the finance has been wound down, rung cazoo - yes the car is now ready, and yes you can repurchase. But now we‚Äôre no longer selling cars really so we‚Äôre not offering finance, and no you can‚Äôt split to put a bit on your credit card to give you section 75 protection and sorry but the warranty is now just 30 days.

Whilst completing the vehicle check we noticed several small imperfections which we put down to 'reasonable wear', however a section of roof rail trim was missing which we raised immediately with the aftercare team. It took a bit of chasing to get an appointment at the local Nissan garage, only for them to tell us they hadn't got the part and they had to go back to Cinch for authorisation. This was all within the warranty period. Unfortunately the 3 month warranty has now expired and neither the garage or Cinch have been in touch, despite emails.

I was then told a day later that all was fixed and a new collection date was arranged. AGAIN, 24hrs before my collection date I am told that there is another fault and that the part necessary isn‚Äôt available and the car was being withdrawn from a sale. I am now without a car and need to travel over 30 miles a day for work, out of pocket due to paying for insurance and tax which I was told to do by cazoo before pick up and still out of pocket for the train tickets.

That part of the experience is spot on. However, if you‚Äôre unlucky to choose a car that has issues like I am having, then the experience is painful and frustrating. I bought a Land Rover Discovery, and after two days, the orange engine light came on. I called Cazoo, and it took me an hour to get through, and they booked me into Bristol Centre in two weeks. I took it there to be told it was a DPF issue and had to book it in for the following week to be cleaned and flushed (I‚Äôm no expert, by the way). I returned it the following week and drove back, bare in mind each journey is an hour each way, and the orange engine light came back on when I got home. I was fuming! I called customer services again (another hour waiting) for them to book me into a local garage, which has another layer of process involved. The garage inspects the problem, which has to be approved by Cazoo (that took them over a week). It took another two weeks for the work to be done. Unfortunately the new DPF has triggered up new issue. I have been without a car for three weeks and I am still waiting from Cazoo to respond to my emails and I don‚Äôt have the time to wait an hour or more to speak to them. This has to be the worst car buying experience I have ever had. I was told by the line manager at the Bristol branch that the company is struggling financially and don‚Äôt have the after care support it is needed to make this a perfect car buying experience. This has really put me off for life from ever buying from Cazoo or any other online car retailer. If you do choose to buy from Cazoo, I hope you‚Äôre lucky enough to buy one that‚Äôs not faulty.

I asked for his statement in writing through an email to prove it since it felt too good to be true he promised he would and surprise surprise no email and was told I'd be contacted within 4 days. It's now been about another month and nothing has happened. Today my car now makes a horrible noise driving due to the dust cover for the brake falling off and resting on the brakes. Currently been on hold for 1 hour and 51 minutes trying to get through to someone with a brain to help me get my money which I highly doubt will actually happen. This has been the worst experience buying a car I've had and I've had a car completely break before after 5 days of buying it.

Then they got us into a main dealer a bit further away, but with the assurance we could have a courtesy car. 2 days before it was due to go in the main dealer rang us and said there would be no courtesy car and they would need it probably all day, maybe longer. We live in the sticks over 40 miles away with no other vehicle. We contacted cinch again. They gave us another option of taking it a local garage, paying for it ourselves, but there was no guarantee we would be reimbursed.  We have requested a manager phone us, but was told they are too busy. We have emailed 5 or 6 times trying to resolve this but have no reply whatsoever. We are happy to wait and go back to the original main dealer who is more local to us, but do still need a courtesy car.

The initial valuation was painless. But was followed up by tons of emails wanting you to progress the sale. I decided to take it further and answered all the questions I could on website. Then had to download the app to provide photos of the car, including defects. In itself that is fine, but once that was done the app becomes useless. I got a call to say that the reserve price would be ¬£250 less that the initial valuation. The car has relatively low milage and is 13 years old so it would be a surprise if there were no marks or scratches. I mentioned that I needed the car for a further week, and they said that they would note that. The car went up for auction and the price bid was higher than the reserve price. I then got a message from the dealer to collect the car the next day and had to point out that we needed the car to the following Saturday and Motorway were aware of this. Then I didn't hear anything from dealer. Chased them on the Thursday and was told the inspection team would contact me the next afternoon. That didn't happen. Chased again on Friday. Was told that the inspection team would come around Saturday afternoon and I would get an hour's notice of their arrival. So spent all Saturday afternoon waiting. Got a text saying that the inspector would arrive before 6:30pm. Then got a call from the dealer shortly before 6pm saying that the inspector was on his way, but his finance team had made a mistake on the bid and would call me back in 5 minutes. Got the call back and was told that the correct bid was ¬£2,000 less than the actual amount they bid. I didn't sell at that price (fortunately I wasn't under any pressure to sell the car at any cost) but got the impression that if I had gone with the 'lower' bid then they would have been happy to come around and collect the car.  So not a great experience and you are at the mercy of the bidder.

I purchased my car based on their sales details on the cinch website, the car arrived on the day that I asked for, the guy that delivered the car was friendly and explained the controls etc, the car wasn‚Äôt as clean as I expected either inside or out, it was explained to me that as it had been driven from Corby I would have to accept that it wouldn‚Äôt be clean, it even had white marker pen on the windows highlighting where it was stored in their compound!! I pointed out a couple of scratches on the door and was told by him that these could be polished out! I notified customer services as I found multiple scratches all over the car, none of these were highlighted on the imperfections‚Äô section on the car‚Äôs details, only two scratches on the alloy wheel!! If they had put these down I wouldn‚Äôt have purchased the car!  Initially customers services were okay, they asked me to take pictures of all the scratches with a tape measure as they will only look at ones over 25mm, ALL of the scratches measured well over this!!  I was told that this has been passed onto the Technical department and I have had no contact since then. I am MOST unhappy and totally disappointed when I received my ¬£17,000 car to find it wasn‚Äôt as advertised on the website. I feel that I have been totally misled in to purchasing a car that I wouldn‚Äôt have if I‚Äôd known that it had multiple scratches all over it! I WOULD DEFINITELY NOT TRUST WHAT THEY SAY ON THE WEBSITE, it‚Äôs definitely pot luck that you get what they say! I will be taking this matter further with both the ombudsman and the advertising agency. Cinch knew about all the imperfections on this car as they had been highlighted on a inspection report done by the previous owner but chose not to put them in their sales description!!  Motto of this story, do not buy what you have not inspected before hand!! I won‚Äôt be making this mistake again!!

My partner and I bought a car with them in September 2023. We reported a fault that became apparent a couple of weeks after. It is now March 2024 and it has yet to be resolved. We have travelled to their Chertsey service centre 4 times. Twice where they did nothing since they did not have a part. But the last occasion takes tops it off with unacceptable levels of incompetence. We arrived at the appointed time, and went about our day but when we returned expecting to get a car that has had a clutch replaced. It turns out that the clutch was never ordered and nobody thought to tell us before we came to collect. The mechanic, although apologetic, said that they had reported the issue to customer service and that they had promised to call but that never happened. Mr. Mechanic said to call the customer service centre but surprise, we've been doing that for the past 6 months and they never have the live chat (which they blatantly boast about in the call waiting line) nor the phone lines manned and have regularly been on hold for more than an hour. They can't do anything about it in the centre because it is ""a separate system and is just not possible"". This is not even the first time this has happened. They fail to book appointments or order parts more than once and don't communicate any of this to us until it is too late. When we do get through to someone on the phone you get referred and ping ponged through a variety of different departments with no accountability or action being done. Even when they do get a booking done, it is always ""sorry we are fully booked for the next month"" and only after a lot of faff and arguing that we get an earlier appointment which is still usually within a few weeks.  We've spent hours on the phone lines (and even this instance they did not pick up and will need to call them back on Monday, again spending another few hours on the phone), hours driving back and forth to and from the service centre and spent more than a few hundred quid out of pocket.

I had a car from cinch in August 2023 and have had alot of issues, some only minor but things keep going wrong with it. Firstly, after a few days I realised that the usb port doesn‚Äôt work but wasn‚Äôt too bothered about it. Secondly, I saw that the temperature gauge for the car was getting very hot, very quickly. When I checked the coolant tank, it was bone dry, again I just thought it hadn‚Äôt been filled like it was supposed to be but now I‚Äôm concerned it may have caused some damage. Another thing is the touchscreen on the dab radio is very temperamental, having to tap on it several times before it registers. There‚Äôs a clunk sound when the car is reversing and I was never told that it requires ad-blue. Nowhere in the car specs,does it say, it needs ad-blue. It wasn‚Äôt until the alarm sounded and light flashed that I became aware of this. Sent an email to them in March but they didn‚Äôt get in touch apart from automated messages so I rang customer service and they said it‚Äôs out of warranty so they aren‚Äôt going to do anything about it and that all diesel cars require ad blue and I should know this. Not happy at all. Yes the car was out of warranty but a few issues during warranty that I wish now I did report and bigger issues just out of warranty. Now got to pay over ¬£400 to fix just some of the issues. ",Unsolicited,diesel cars require ad blue,-0.8969,-0.8834,-0.2755,https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/cinch.co.uk?page=39&sort=recency

However, I've sold a few now with you so I'll give you my honest thoughts on how to make the process better for the seller.  First off is the price that you suggest based on the information supplied never seems to be what the real person says it's worth.  I'd understand this if the cars sold were weaker than their description but in my case I've sold four cars, all very nearly new, most with lots of factory extras and not one stone chip or mark between them, yet each time the real person says its worth less than what you quote moments earlier.  Second is the process of the Auction.  You used to show each bid as it came in and notify me and if the reserve was not met it allowed me the option to accept an offer.  You've changed this and now we only see if there has been any offer at all after the auction closes.  I can understand there may be issues with telling me which business has bid but it would be nice to know that bids were coming in as it gets you to feel more involved in the process and the new system for me is less enjoyable.  The final point I'd make is that it would be good for you to have code of conduct with each buyer so they know what is expected from them.  I've sold at least four cars with you and the dealers are usually top notch.  Communicative and professional.  The last one was not.  I suspect this was down to him being in the role for days rather than years but communication was very poor meaning that settlement took much longer than it needed to.

First, personally pick up your vehicle instead of opting for delivery. This gives you the chance to thoroughly inspect the car and the freedom to walk away if needed. Second, conduct a meticulous inspection before signing any documents. Although the pre-sale process was efficient, our post-sale experience was incredibly frustrating and quite terrible.  We discovered mould under the centre armrest and, with all the doors and windows shut, a very strong and pervasive smell of cigarette smoke.  Neither were spotted before handover (it was inspected with all the doors open, and who looks under the centre armrest when being rushed through a PDI?).  Our attempts to immediately address these issues with the company were met with long wait times on calls (up to 45 mins) and e-mails going unanswered.  Using their Digital Assistant/WhatsApp elicited a limited and unhelpful response (ie, an offer of ¬£25 to have it cleaned), a stark contrast to the prompt pre-sales service.  I wanted to return the car but personal (medical) circumstances meant I could not do so in their timescale and after eventually being able to talk to a person, I stupidly agreed to having it re-valeted at their expense.  Even getting to that point was a painful exercise.  Eventually that was agreed, but only with a relatively modest budget.  This has only resolved the mould issue (although the staining is still there), the smoke odour returned within 10 days.  As a result, my wife will not use the car and we cannot take the grandkids in it (what are they breathing?), so two months down the line it sits unloved and unwanted on the drive.  It is diminishing in value and our ability to resell it.  Our oversight in not inspecting the car more rigorously upon delivery was a mistake on our part but in our defence, we already have an identical model and didn‚Äôt need to know about all the bells and whistles; you just don‚Äôt expect such issues.

It‚Äôs cliche but REALLY wished I read and payed attention to the reviews on here. Cinch customer service is the WORSE I‚Äôve ever experienced, and that‚Äôs not an exaggeration. The company focus their efforts on new Sales, and that‚Äôs why if you happen to get the vehicle you ordered and don‚Äôt need any follow up customer service, then you‚Äôll likely have a very good experience. The struggles begin where you receive a vehicle that doesn‚Äôt match the description or there is something wrong that wasn‚Äôt made clear on the website. Firstly, be prepared to be on hold for upwards of 45mins just to speak to someone. I‚Äôve been on hold for over one hour then the call dropped with no answer. That‚Äôs an hour I won‚Äôt get back! Secondly, be prepared for days before any response to email. Contrary to what they say on the website, they don‚Äôt respond within 24hrs or 48hrs for that matter. Thirdly, no response at all via WhatsApp - it‚Äôs an autobot feature - not real persons responding to you. I was so frustrated that I had to call the new Sales line to get help. And not surprisingly, someone answered on the 2nd ring, compared to holding over 1 hour on the customer support line!! Fourthly, when the issues I initially raised were finally picked up, some were acknowledged that they would resolve, some they said they wouldn‚Äôt. One of the issues was around severe corrosion of the brakes and discs. I took pictures the day after I received the vehicle (received it in the evening before) and sent via email. I was advised days later to take the vehicle to Halfords for a free break check. The report came back that the brakes and discs were excessively corroded and needed to be changed. Days went by and no proper response to the report from Halfords. I felt I was being ignored! When I finally got a response 4 days later I was told they need to send someone to look at the vehicle because the pictures I sent weren‚Äôt clear. Why wasn‚Äôt this done from the very beginning when I raised the issue??? At this point the 14 day trial period is nearly ending, plus I had no further response to another issue I had initially raised to which they said they would resolve it. At this point I felt I was being given the runaround and these issues were being intentionally dragged out to increase the costs I‚Äôm already incurring, so I might be more likely to keep the vehicle. I had lost all confidence in Cinch and decided to return the vehicle right away. Which brings me to the final point. What they don‚Äôt tell you on the website is that the process takes longer than 14days, and you can end up spending upwards of ¬£300, depending on the vehicle. That‚Äôs expensive just to test drive a vehicle when you can go to a physical dealership and test drive for FREE!!!! You have to tax the vehicle and pay for insurance for those 21 days - it takes a further week for them to come and collect the vehicle from you if you decide to return it - for which you have to keep the vehicle insured. The information on the website doesn‚Äôt make this clear up front and I will raise a formal complaint with the Ombudsman or FCA. It isn‚Äôt as simple and straightforward as they make it out to be. It‚Äôs not clear on the costs you should expect to cover and how much this could potentially be!!! A word to Cinch, please don‚Äôt respond with your robotic answer to this review. My matter is closed and there‚Äôs nothing you are going to do to resolve. If you were intent to help, you would have helped me resolve it at the time.

The dealer who purchased the Z4 duly arrived at the time he said he would and after inspecting the car transferred the cash by BACS on the spot and whisked it away on his car carrier.

Cazoo do some things well; the handover was a smooth and pleasant experience (thank you, Alan) and the initial response to my concerns was fairly swift and positive.

How it works is to list features and a higher spec than you are likely to receive, knowing that many will simply accept they haven‚Äôt got all they hoped but will keep the car anyway as they enjoy it. This way the value is inflated and more interest garnered. Another sinister practise is the one of advertising a 7 day grace period in which you can return the car when the legal period is 14 days, something which is mentioned way down in their terms and conditions. On top of this, the warranty period is 90 days as opposed to the 12 months you‚Äôll mostly find elsewhere which suggests little confidence in their stock. You may find what you‚Äôre looking for and all may be well but, please, be diligent and make absolutely sure you‚Äôll be getting all that you‚Äôre expecting.

Jessica Regan in Customer Finance was very helpful as was Rudi Ginsberg in Customer Experience. However top marks go to delivery driver Jamie (aka Jahy) who was very polite, courteous and knowledgeable and to Joseph Brown (Customer Relations Executive) who sorted out my problems which had made me score an initial 4 star review. The reasons for the 4 stars not 5 were on 2 points. Firstly there was a number written on the windscreen in some sort of pen / paint which took some difficulty to fully scratch it off by myself with a sharp knife. This should surely come as removed as standard when the car is delivered rather than asking the customer to remove it. Secondly the car came with no front car mats. Once Joseph had contacted me following my review he agreed to a good will gesture for the windscreen issue and to re-imburse me for my car mats which he said i should have expected to have had in a car that new. I am therefore changing the review to 5 stars as i am now happy that Cinch have gone above and beyond to deal with my 2 issues",Verified,cinch make car buying extremely easy,0.9655,0.9529,0.4927,https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/cinch.co.uk?page=43&sort=recency

We've purchased over 100 cars through the platform, but we've also had to reject numerous vehicles due to misleading sellers and undisclosed issues.The fundamental issue lies in CARWOW's prioritization of customer protection over supporting buyers like us. It's a rare occurrence to find a platform where the scales tip so heavily in favor of customers, to the detriment of those actually footing the bills - us, the buyers.Rejecting vehicles with undisclosed mechanical or bodywork issues, while essential to protect our profit margins, has led to repercussions from CARWOW. We've been confronted with what can only be described as a form of blackmail. CARWOW has threatened us and other dealers with suspension, citing our 'high' cancellation rate as grounds for punitive action.What CARWOW fails to understand is that in our line of work, such rejection rates are par for the course. We cannot afford to invest in faulty vehicles, especially those that have already been rejected by other platforms like 'We Buy Any Car'. It's not just about preserving our margins; it's about maintaining our integrity as a dealership.The most egregious aspect of this experience is CARWOW's willingness to manipulate situations to secure their fees. They suspend accounts for failing to purchase vehicles, pushing sellers to seek alternatives and essentially punishing us for our caution.Moreover, CARWOW's tactics result in tangible financial losses for us. We're left covering transportation costs for vehicles we ultimately reject due to misrepresentation by sellers. It's not uncommon for us to book inspections and transport, only to discover undisclosed issues upon closer examination.CARWOW's practices have reached a point where they're not just frustrating; they're outright damaging to businesses like ours. The recent suspension of our account, coupled with the loss of transportation deposits and disrupted seller relationships, highlights the lack of consideration for our operational realities.In conclusion, we at Supreme Motor Group have reached our limit with CARWOW. The platform's blatant disregard for dealer concerns and transparent pursuit of profits at our expense is no longer tolerable. We're opting out and recommending other dealerships to steer clear, directing them instead towards more balanced platforms like MOTORWAY, which prioritize fairness and integrity over profit margins.CARWOW's attempts to emulate successful models like MOTORWAY have fallen short, and until significant changes are made, we stand by our decision to sever ties with this platform.Sincerely, Supreme Motor Group",Unsolicited,discover undisclosed issues upon closer examination,-0.7281,-0.6053,0.0,https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/carwow.co.uk?page=45&sort=recency

I had to stop on the hill and get out of the car to force the clutch back up, in the middle of traffic. Clearly not a ‚Äúone off‚Äù, so I looked up the issue online and found a bunch of people saying the same thing, that it‚Äôs a known manufacturer fault, which was the cause of a lot of recalls in 2019. I emailed Cazoo, asking for their help and to explain how a known manufacturer fault can possibly get past their ‚Äúextensive‚Äù checks. After 8 days, I got a reply which essentially said to contact the manufacturer and that Cazoo can‚Äôt help. Zero explanation or advice other than this. I followed up to reiterate my question of how they can sell me a car with such an issue, but so far I‚Äôve had no response at all. I sent that email on 16th December 2023, and have chased it up twice, and nothing. After looking into selling the car and realising I would have to pay extra towards the finance settlement myself (despite a ¬£4k deposit), I raised a case with the motor ombudsmen‚Ä¶ only for the ombudsmen to respond advising that Cazoo is not accredited. Why would a company with such a big customer base NOT be accredited to the ombudsmen? So, in this case, I‚Äôve lost money and am left with a faulty car. MOT is due in a couple of weeks and no doubt that will be costing me as well. Disgusting company to not even offer me an explanation, they literally could not care less about their customers. All seems pretty great at first when they‚Äôre selling you the car, but doesn‚Äôt last too long after that. Please just avoid at all costs, I wish I‚Äôd have read reviews beforehand.

Email's go to and fro but nothing gets resolved. Great to buy from is Cinch, but if like me anything goes wrong be prepared for a long-haul fight to get Cinch to do anything or take responsibility of an issue on your car. I'm giving up fighting Cinch and paying for this repair from a bank loan I've had to take out to cover the repair myself as i need the car for my job, and waiting for Cinch, well i could be waiting for ever.

Once a car was decided and my car was part exchanged each step was followed with links to help me  tax, insure  , pay etc. Each email explained next steps . The car I chose was pictured as it arrived to Cinch so no surprises. Except when it was delivered to me  any problems had been dealt with including 2 new tires and a windscreen. Daryl who delivered my car, txted me to say he was on his way then again to say this was my 15 minute window and then to say my new car was being washed and would arrive in 10 minutes! How exciting.. On arrival all paper work was checked (having explained to me what was needed  in emails) Then Daryl took me out to me new car and explained everything to me . What an amazing service , so exciting not to have to try and sell my car and then go and look at cars.. My new car comes with a free  90 warranty, 3 free days insurance if needed and a 14 day no quibble money back guarantee. So, if you really want an exciting service leaving you so happy then look at Cinch for a car, take your time they may not have what you need straight away but boy is it worth waiting for. Yes, you could say you would get more selling your car privately but  then you have to advertise and have tire kickers wanting a bargain etc so in the end it makes sense to do the whole thing at the same time new car delivered old car driven away HAPPY DAYS !!

I belong to a generation where you would have historically visited the local garages, kicked a few tyres, picked the car you liked, taken it for a test drive and if you were happy would have parted with your hard earned and driven away into the sunset. Now everything appears to have moved on in the car-buying world, I guess it's the same for other retailing too. Now you don't get to see your car 'in person', deciding if you like it or not or even take it for a test drive before paying for it. As I wanted a particular feature on my new (to me) car I made an enquiry with Cazoo to ensure it was included on this particular model and I was assured that it was, so despite being a little nervous about the whole process I went ahead in the knowledge that I had Cazoo's 7-day return policy if I wasn't happy. I parted with my cash and in due course the car arrived. The delivery of the vehicle was probably the best part of the overall experience, Steve was helpful and friendly and ensured that at least his part of the service was handled to his utmost. When it arrived, due to unforeseen circumstances (nothing to do with Cazoo, just one of life's curved balls) I was unable to examine the car in any great detail, other than a cursory check to make sure there were no obvious faults/marks to the outside of the car that I hadn't been previously made aware of and that it had 4 wheels etc. So (electronic) paperwork completed I took delivery of the car, which I must admit, at least externally, looked fantastic. A couple of hours later I decided to go for a test drive. Imagine my disappointment when I started the car that the first thing I noticed that the feature that I checked was on the car (a HUD) and was assured that it was, actually wasn't on this car! I was gutted! I contacted Cazoo on Friday 16/02 and after a (very) long wait on the phone was told by a Customer Care Representative that they weren't personally able to deal with my query but would talk to a supervisor and get back to me. By the following Tuesday I still hadn't heard from them so decided I would contact them again. I was informed that the best method was to 'chat' to them so started the process at number 8 in the queue. 2 hours and 10 minutes later I was down to position 1..............only for the call/chat to disconnect before I had a chance to speak to anyone! So, back on the phone again. This time the wait was just over 30 minutes which after the 2 hours plus waiting to 'chat' seemed like a win! This time the guy that I spoke to was apologetic for my experience to date and promised to get back to me. Further to my previous experience I wasn't sure that this would even happen but everyone deserves a second chance so I put the phone down and waited. A short while later I got my call-back. The guy once again apologised and said that I could either return the car or keep the car with a gesture of goodwill. At this point, taking external factors into account, again nothing to do with Cazoo, I decided to keep the car as it was. The ""goodwill"" was sent to me in due course and that pretty much concludes my experience which overall was a mixed bag. The good was really excellent and the bad was really not so good! Finally, I'm not too sure I would go through this way of buying a car again, or at least would go through the car with a toothcomb (which under other circumstances I would probably have done) when it was delivered. On the positive I think (other than the missing HUD option) the car was as described, certainly in relation to marks/scratches/scuffs etc on the outside but would have liked to know that there were other things missing such as car mats (cost me ¬£150 to get luxury mats from my jaguar dealer), the covers for the Isofix fixings in the back seat (cost me ¬£64) and an owners manual (¬£80).

Upon the collection of my vehicle the outside was clean however the inside was not, the boot was covered in dog hair, the driver/ front passenger footwells were covered in mud, dirt and the odometer ddashboard was extremely dirty to which I assumed would just require a wipe down however the smears/dirt are on the others otherside of the plastic and will require this to be removed professionally so it can be cleaned properly and not cause a distraction while driving. The rest of the car will also require a professional valet. On Monday 19th the 3rd time I had drove the car since collection the battery had died and I had to be jump started. The RAC attended the vehicle and reported a new battery was required and he could fit this however I would need to pay for it! I refuse as i had only had the vehicle 3 days! I contacted yourselves by phone after 50 mins on hold I spoke to a member of the customer service team and was authorised to take the vehicle to kwirk fit for the new battery and a vehicle inspection on your account. The earliest appointment I could get with my local kwirk fit was Wednesday 830am. Once I dropped the vehicle of I was advised I will be contacted by phone with their findings, that afternoon I received the phone call that it was not the battery but it was the alternator and they had tried to contact yourselves to obtain authorisation to repair this however could not get through. I then again contacted yourselves after another 45 min on hold I was told they had to speak to kwirk fit and not me! I then phoned kwirk fit and advised them this and was told he will do best to get through however due to how busy they were couldn't stay on hold. After another hour I received the car to confirm this had been authorised and part had been ordered however the part will not arrive until Friday 23rd!.

It was a simple process to set up, and easy to do it all online with a phone call from them to check everything. So far so good (and why this is 2 stars). Then it went south quickly. They suggested a price online, but then on the phone recommended a lower price as a ""reserve"". I said no, but then they said they won't list it at the original valuation price they themselves had indicated. Fine - car went for auction and got the reserve (probably a way to ensure their ""success rate"" and drag you in with a higher quote so you use them). The dealer they matched me with couldn't come for a week, so I turned down other potential buyers to be true to my CarWow promise. Then, when the dealer finally found the time to come they found something, undisclosed wrong with the car (they gave some vague excuse of a part being replaced wrongly - complete nonsense, and not a good line to take with someone who knows their car) and dropped the bid to...wait for it...40% of the reserve. I'm back to square 1 and a very very unhappy customer. I would advise anyone looking to sell their car to really understand what CarWow offers, how they match you with dealers and how they do their quotes and reserve. If you're OK with all that then great. I am not and will not use them again.

I expected this as I had same replies with a Hyundai i10 order for my wife. We now have a new VW E-UP in the garage as the dealer had it in the showroom. For my replacement, there are no Rav4's available until May 24. Same as a Bristol dealer advised yesterday...and May is very optimistic! Could be June or July as it is built in Japan. My gripe is that CarWow says the dealer has a new unregistered Rav4 Excel in Decuma Grey in stock. I have screen shot to show that I am not barking mad. I have submitted the reference for Carwow to investigate. Hardly any of these dealers have any stock in the UK, and now spent several days tracking availability.

I also found it more difficult to get hold of Carwow staff to arrange pick up and communication with the buyer after the sale.

On the day the buyer came to collect the car it transpired Carwow haven't reported that the car would need new back tyres which I mentioned to them both in initial write up and follow up phone call.

It‚Äôs now in the garage again but they can‚Äôt run the tests needed without Cinch‚Äôs permission but Cinch are not answering the garages request to test. Day 2 in the garage and counting and me without a car. The garage has categorically said that they have sold me a car that is not fit for purpose and there is no way I could have created this problem with the 1500miles I have travelled in it. I spoke to someone at Cinch today, after 20mins on hold, who has opened up a request for a return and refund on the car, but could not guarantee I would get a refund. I just want my money back, and to be reimbursed for lost work days and taxis. I do not need this hassle in my life. Ultimately they have broken their side of the deal by selling me a broken car. I would never had spent ¬£8000 on a car that needs a new engine. I will wait to see Cinch‚Äôs next move before I leave another review. I hope it can be higher than 1 star. I also hope that they deal with it quickly, as I first flagged up this issue nearly 2 months ago and I still have a broken car that I paid ¬£8000 for.

After the usual delays in finally getting to speak to someone they offered to carry out repairs, however this would have taken them several days to get quotes and organise and they wouldn't organise a courtesy car for us in the meantime either. As the car was unsafe to drive, in the event of an accident you would not be able to rescue someone from the drivers side we decided to return the car, which as it is unsafe to drive cannot be collected for another week. In the meantime we have no car, money is not refunded until 3-5 days after returning and also advised we shouldn't apply for finance until the agreement is ended which is 10 days after the car is returned.

I was greeted with a friendly face and was offered free tea or coffee which was very nice. My Leon was checked over and accepted, and my new Ateca was unveiled to me. It was in beautiful condition just as the photos showed on the website. I was taken through all the new bits of tech etc. and the basics of driving an automatic gearbox.

A month down the line and still no car! We ordered a car at the end of Feb, which wasn't exactly smooth as the website glitched and told us the car had been sold at the last stage twice - which resulted in multiple finance applications and 3 orders on the Cinch account. Eventually got that sorted and we asked if this mess would cause a delay to the order. Told on the phone it shouldn't and that we should be able to get it by 8th March or there abouts, website said 12th. However, it was then arranged for delivery on 18th. 18th rolls around, we're excited to get the car, and then we got a call to say there had been a delay and that it would be delivered on 23rd March. Still not sure why there was a delay. Then  yesterday we got a call saying there was a delay (again! Though the advisor wasn't aware this wasn't the first time) and that the delivery should still get to us on 23rd but much later in the day. Today comes, we don't get the call back as promised so we chase up - they said they'd get back to us within the hour but we allowed a few. No call back, so we chased again - and in this call it has been pushed back until 26th! Meanwhile we're paying insurance on a car we don't have, we've wasted 2 days just waiting for a car that then doesn't come, and the whole experience has left a rather bitter taste. We'd feel a lot better about the situation if Cinch were more proactive in communicating problems and were clearer in telling us what the issue actually is. Strongly considering cancelling the order since this car seems to be a unicorn, but we're holding off while we find a suitable alternative.  If they deliver in the meantime, great, but it had better arrive exactly as described, and they had better give us the price quoted for our part exchange. Would have appreciated some kind of goodwill gesture by now, but nothing has been offered to remedy the significant inconvenience. If we could go back in time, we would avoid Cinch completely, so I'm posting this review to hopefully spare others from a similar experience.

It started with the car not arriving on the agreed delivery day. I was assured that Customer Services would call me later that day, but no-one did. After a number of calls, the car arrived 4 days later (13 days after placing the order). When it arrived, it had five more scratches/marks than highlighted on their imperfections list, and it was filthy inside - muddy, dog hairs, and smelt of wet dog. Having raised these with the delivery man, he advised to call Cinch to report the issues. Cinch accepted the car fell short of standards and advised that I‚Äôd need to get costs for the bodywork repairs, and a cost for a valet. Whilst getting costs, I was informed that the front tyres were illegal and the back tyres weren‚Äôt far off. When I reported this back to Cinch and forwarded the quotes, they said I‚Äôd need to get more quotes, and get a tyre health report. The tyre report said one needed changing immediately and three had an advisory to change. Cinch agreed to pay for one tyre to be replaced, and half of the valet cost. They wouldn‚Äôt pay for the body work costs until they had more quotes. After much running around, I was sick of the whole experience so I sent the car back. The whole process with Cinch was shockingly terrible and I wouldn‚Äôt go near them again. Buying a car this way was a first for me - I thought the process would be simple and professional - but it was appalling. It cost me hours of my time - on the phone, emailing, and obtaining quotes.

I booked delivery, and booked a days holiday for this. On the day, I had a phone call stating that the vehicle had been damaged during transit and the wheel trim was hanging off, so will need to be takien back to the garage. I then asked if the car had been in an accident whilst travelling. I was told by support ""definitely not, we wouldn't lie to you about that"", she then sent me a picture, which showed a dent and scratches and I said this car has definitely been in an accident, they continued to deny this. I then asked if they were going to reduce the price of the car, as now damaged and be compensated for taking a day's holiday. They said ""we don't do that, Cinch do not provide compensation"". After many back and forths they admitted it had been in a collision, but still would not reduce the price, as the damage was 'cosemetic' and the value of the car would not be reduced. I stated that this is untrue, if I took the car to their sister company 'webuyanycar' I am certain the valuation would be different pre and post accident. They did not care about my experience or the cost incurred by me.

When it arrived it was filthy inside with bits of trim missing.  There was even rubbish from the previous keeper in the door pockets.  I had to spend a whole day cleaning it.  Wiper blades needed replacing.  Coolant level was low.  There is an odd rumbling noise coming from the car that needs investigating.  The trim at the base of the windscreen was unattached and letting in water.  The advert said that the car had been serviced in February but no evidence in the service history - in fact the service history suggests it is 2 years overdue.  Everything suggests that the car did not have any sort of pre-delivery inspection.  Emailed a complaint on 12 March 2024 but not received an acknowledgement or response.  Chased up with another email on Monday 18 March 2024 but still no response.  Just been in a call queue for 33 minutes only to get cut off.

When the car was delivered to us there was a dent and scratch on the back passenger door that they said they would fix for them to send someone out and it was to severe for it to get fixed on the side of the road. I called them to let know that it was to go into a body shop and there reply was that he was to find a body shop to do the work which was hard to do when u work 6days a week. I eventually got a quote and they said I was too much and wanted a more detailed estimate.

From day one the engine management light was on and off. I put it down to a sensor issue as I assumed the car had been stationary for a while and it seemed to drive ok. After this, I noticed a juddering with the brakes (I was used to driving an old Honda so, at the beginning, it felt smooth), this is when the engine light stayed on and I phoned for help. It was promptly booked into my local Mercedes garage. They found all brake pads and discs needed attention, a ball joint had gone (MOT failure) and an issue with the nitrous oxide sensor. Basically I was left with no car for 6 days. No courtesy car and no communication over what was happening. I strongly advise not to use the text or WhatsApp option to communicate as it can take a couple of days to get a response. Long story short, I phoned Cinch today and asked for the car to be taken back and the credit company to be dealt with and money taken so far, reimbursed. We will see if I get my money back in full. I can not recommend this company and will never buy a car from them again. This was all in 3 weeks.

Car arrived on time, but when we drove the car to get fuel, approx 1/4 mile away, on the way back home a red light on the dashboard and warning sign on the screen saying ""engine fault, get repaired"" came on. I immedately called Cinch and spoke to a customer service agent, after holding on for 50 mins. He said he would get the AA to come to look at the car. He asked me to call them to arrange. I called the AA who said they would not come to see the car as it was still driveable. I called Cinch back, and got the same customer service agent, who told me they would get it booked in to a local dealer for repair, and that he would look after this to make sure we ere satisfied. Said he would call me back before 5pm that day. ""Nothing happened"". I emailed Cinch the next day, and a different customer service agent said they were trying to book it in to the local dealer. I received another email later that day saying the car was booked in for repair with the dealer 3 weeks later. I emailed back to say that if this was the case I would need a replacement car, as we had traded my mother-in-law car in with Cinch, which they had taken away, and also that the timescale would be outside the 14 day money back guarantee, and I would require this guarantee to start when the car was repaired and road worthy. The next day I received a further email, from another different customer service agent, saying they cannot extend the 14 day money back guarantee, and that the best they can do was supply a loan car for a maximum of 7 days, and added let her know when I would like the loan car. Absolutely rediculous considering they supply goods not fit for purpose. after emails going back and forward regarding wanting our money back, I managed to contact, by phone, Cinch returns department, and spoke to a manager called Alex. He was the only person I got in Cinch who was sympathetic and talked sense. He told me the process they would start, which included the uplift of the faulty car, and the return of the money paid. This has all been duly done, but I have submitted a complaint with Cinch regarding all of this, and also a claim for the ¬£65 of fuel put in the car, and also the ¬£80 extra on my mother-in-law premium she paid for her car insurance due to changing her car. Cinch email said they will get back to me within 8 weeks, and I am still waiting on a response to this complaint. BEWARE THIS COMPANY.

After hours of being on a call and delayed responses from them, they managed to get us a repair date on the 1/3/24 which was outside the 14 day return period. The car was picked up on 1/3/24 and they provide us with a dorsal replacement which means that we have to pay for our electric cars down payment plus fuel for the replacement car. We have tried calling them and writing to them with limited to no response. They would not respond to emails until I wrote to them at least 6 - 7 times and the response I received was ‚Äúthe car has been received at our workshop‚Äù. My husband has been on calls with them ever since and tried to get an update on the status but the customer support team are not able to provide an update on the vehicle or even get through to their own repair team.

Firstly, I was pressured to leave a trustpilot review before even leaving with the car. I rated it 4 and the individual showing me around took my phone out of the car ""to put registration details"" and then changed my rating to a 5 without my knowledge. Then as soon as I drove the car there was a tyre pressure warning, which is shocking seeing as the car is supposed to be safety checked. I logged a report straight away, but 4 days later still not response from cazoo. By then my tyre was completely flat and so I couldn't make use of the 7 day trial. I was then advised on a Sunday to go to kwikfit to get the tyre changed. This kwikfit tried to call the cazoo payment authorising line but this was not open (and I was not informed this by customer service), I therefore had to pay ¬£172 out of my own pocket for a tyre due to no fault of my own. I then contacted customer service for a reimbursement to which they said they can only give me ¬£106 as they would only authorise a budget tire. However,  this was due to no fault of my own so it doesn't make sense! I asked for a full reimbursement but have still not been responded to. The 7 day trial has not really been 7 days, and I've had work so not managed to go and change another tyre that also needs changing according  to the kwikfit report and my 7 days is approaching tomorrow. I have not been treated well by cazoo, they don't seem to care about reported issues with the car. The reported issue meant I cannot even drive the car in my 7 day trial, and I've had to pay money out of my own pocker, but it just hasn't been taken seriously.

Two days after getting the car back the same issue occurred and with many arguments between cazoo trying to persuade the mechanic it was just the battery, the wet belt was changed along with a number of other related issues. This was ¬£700 of work and a customer should never have to plead for basic needs. Not to mention I had received no emails of updates throughout this whole process and was even given 4 hours to drop a courtesy car off and drive 69 miles to pick my car up otherwise I was without a car again.

They said even a basic mechanical check would have identified these issues and that the engine fault signal had been recently cleared before the car had been sold. They said the car should never have been sold to us in that condition. The car required approximately ¬£4000-5000 of repairs. Cinch agreed to take the car back, but it would need to be picked up by a truck as it was not safe for one of their employees to drive the car, an explicit acknowledgment that they had sold us an unsafe car. This resulted in a delay in returning the car. It took a further two weeks to get our refund as the haulage company didn't immediately return the car. I had to personally call the haulage company and arrange to have the car returned to Cinch. Had the engine light not come on during the first two weeks, we would have been stuck with essentially a worthless car. despite returning the car, we are still significantly out of pocket, not to mention the stress, inconvenience and loss of time.

I have bought cars before, but always been present to inspect and test the car. I bought a car from Cinch last year for just under ¬£16k. It was listed with no imperfections and I did all of the usual background checks. In short - I have had nothing but problems since. The car was damaged in transit and Cinch have not been transparent about the extent of the damage and have withheld information. I have had problems with the car, some of which Cinch have addressed, but others remain outstanding. I have spent so much time dealing with different staff and having to repeat and duplicate information. It has been nothing but a headache and waste of my time and money.

The sales team then advised that the best they could do would be to go back to the dealer and see if they would increase their bid by a few hundred pounds. I reluctantly agreed to this and waited for a phone call the next day. No call came and I eventually received an email with an even lower offer than before.

I returned the car under the 14 day policy and it was collected over a week later so I had to purchase insurance at cost to myself for it to sit on my drive. I was told the finance element would be sorted but to ring them just in case and I spent hours on hold waiting to speak to both parties about this. I was told when the V5 arrived I would get my deposit back but after weeks of waiting it didn't turn up. When I contacted them again they said the car had never been registered in my name.

However, Cinch needs to conduct more thorough quality checks on their vehicals before selling! after about a week of having the car, i realised the tail light bulb had gone, so i went to check which bulb i needed to replace it with, which i then noticed that the back windscreen had previously been replaced because everytime the boot door was closed you could hear all the bits of glass left over inside the door rattle about, and some bits were managing to pour out all inside the boot. I looked closer and there was little bits of tinted glass left everywhere! All in the crevases and the lining of the boot! Not only did they leave all the shattered glass from the old screen behind, they did half a job replacing it as the back de mister wires were not connected with the new windscreen properly, the new wires were just hanging loose. So that explained why my back window wasn't de-misting in the mornings, and ill probably have to check the fuses now as well after connecting the wires up properly. I get that buying a car second hand has its risks but seriously, either get some mechanics that can do a proper job, or carry out detailed checks of every area of the car before selling! My mother also had a car from cinch and they messed her about by lying to her about the car having service history evidence, saying that they will send her a copy, only to wait to tell her AFTER she had bought the car that they didnt actually have it. Seems quite sketchy to me.

The car fetched more than I expected and certainly more than other online or main dealers were offering me. But my buyer was a bit suspect. Made a very high offer and tried to take ¬£500 off at the inspection. He based it on the tyres saying he wouldn‚Äôt sell it with the tyres as they were and would have to replace them, however, this was noted in the pictures and the car passed an MOT 2 weeks before with no advisories or issues. It was a really nice, very well cared for car with no marks, rust or damage and very low mileage for her age. You could see the inspector looking for something to knit pick at to justify trying to knock off money. Really made me suspect the buyer was gaming the system- bid high with a motive of knocking money off when they are on your door step. That part made me feel uncomfortable. Added to the fact that we are quite rural and I agreed to pick the driver up from the train station so once he was all the way out here so I was in a position of either take his offer or drive him back to station and start the process again.

When I received the vehicle I was asked if I wanted to test drive to ensure I was 100% sure with my purchase otherwise they would take it away, which was a nice touch. Following this, I had an issue with my breaks so went onto a live chat to understand how I raise this and the process - where was told I had a 90 day warranty. The car was booked into the garage and was awaiting Cinch‚Äôs approval for the repairs. The repair was rejected as my breaks were covered under 30 days and not the 90 days as previously explained to me. On review, I raised the issue at day 32 but queried the process before this and it was still rejected. I then had to pay out my own pocket for the repair but then Milly and Joe from Cinch contacted me to understand my experience and they were appalled at the service I received.

However there was also a small crack in the right side rear light casing, as well as a large scuff on the inside of the rear window and multiple badly painted over scratches on the boot hatch.

The delivery driver said what a lovely drive he had coming from Oxford to Manchester. Also that the car had noisy window wipers but that was the car model. Drove the car at 60mph on the motorway and the car wheel and driver seat was shaking and vibrating quite intensely. Which was a worry. After numerous calls, whatapp chats and emails they booked in the garage where was discovered if needed completely balancing on all wheels, this resolved the vibrating but also there was creaking when driving slowly around corners or over speed bumps. This has not been resolved. The garage said that the inside wheel was damaged and needed replacing immediately. That was 7 days ago. Cinch after countless emails and delays have emailed to say they will replace the wheel and as yet no date in the garage and no firm plan to get the creaking addressed. Additionally the roof bar was assessed when the wheel balancing was corrected and needs a body work specialist and there is no plan for this either. It‚Äôs really concerning I have paid in full 19k to have all of these issues. I did want to send back as suspension could be costly. But I am being told 7-10 days to get money back after returning the car. I have tried and tried to get this resolved pre the 14 days and this has just been dragged out with poor response times.

The car sold on the first auction day for more than the reserve. And above what other sites and dealers had offered me on p/x. On the same day the company purchasing emailed me with all the info they required and arranged for collection on a day that suited me. The driver that came to collect the vehicle was polite and helpful and I was paid online within around 15mjns and before he left with the vehicle.

I got my new car from Cinch today and it's beautiful, but, the driver literally took my keys, handed me mine and legged it. So off the bat, not a great start. Took the car for a drive and was lovely, then I hit 63mph and it shook the bones out of me to the point where it was hard to control. I called their support 3 times and each time I was cut off after exactly 1h 1m. I was furious. I called again but chose to pick the, buy a car option and it rang twice and had an answer. So  great to sell you something but no interest in hearing issues I think. So tomorrow I have to take my car to Kwik fit to have tracked and balanced at their expense. Buying my car was easy as was my trade in. But purely because of their lack of after sales, I personally wouldn't ever buy from them again. ***UPDATE**** Took the car to Quik fit. They set alignment etc. I took it for a drive and the steering wobble stopped but the car is still shaking the bones at between 63 and 70mpg. Terrified to drive it. They are so bad that they reply on trustpilot to get further information but can't make a call or answer. For anyone with issues with this lot, call the number for buying a car and they answer. I have since found another issue where my wing mirrors won't close. I now have no car for work. That a joke of a company. Come and take your junk away and refund me like it says on your 14 day guarantee. ***New update*** They have offered to repair my car, the one that was delivered that I drove no more than 29 mins, go figure, but can't pick it up until 9th of April.

I bought a honda 67 plate CRV before Christmas 23. I paid the top price because this car was low mileage and had a 'full dealer service history'. When delivered the service log showed that prior to delivery Cinch had contracted, BCA Fleet services (part of the same group), to do a pre delivery service (engine oil and filter change). The car was actually due for a 6 year service (a much more extensive service costing over ¬£1200). Having contacted them to resolve the issue they arranged for the car to be inspected by  the local honda dealership. This identified a problem with the rear brakes and confirmed the 6 year service was several months overdue. Cinch, aftercare authorised the break repair but declined to do the overdue service. This process continued over nearly 3 months. Unable to get Cinch to undertake the service I had no option but to resort to the courts. Once the claim was submitted online which landed on the Cinch complaints department desk, within 90min had offered to undertake the service 'without prejudice'. To their credit this work was eventually done.  It did include the extra brake work which was undertaken at the same time and turned out to be more extensive than at first sight.

The car was a 2011 plate I'd bought from new and did my own servicing once out of guarantee. However I was not credited for full service history even though the service book was signed and dated and I had all the receipts and invoices for oil and parts used over the years. This is unfair and limits the number of dealers who bid. I looked after my car better than any garage would have done. Motorway need to review their policy on Home Mechanics who are skilled and thorough and have the paperwork to verify all the work has been done. The car did sell and the dealer tried to haggle the price down but I refused. They paid the final auction price which was about ¬£500 lower than a fair private sale figure.

Their customer support staff took a while to get in touch and were not forthcoming in providing the missing parts as they were not listed on the advertisement, and said cinch would not be providing them. For a high value purchase (over ¬£20k) I would expect the advert to explicitly state if some key parts of the car would not be supplied. After posting this review I was promptly contacted by their team and offered a reimbursement for the cost of floor mats and to have our wiper blades replaced, which I also mentioned were not smooth.

On 12 Jan it suffered a catastrophic engine failure on a major road, which nearly resulted in a truck piling into it. The car was recovered to a local garage who carried out an initial assessment and discovered that there was no compression on any cylinder - indicating a cylinder head failure.  They also noted that, in their opinion, the car had not been properly serviced in around 3-years (judging by the age and state of the oil filter) - so much for the comprehensive 300-point pre-delivery inspection!  The issue was reported to Cazoo through their website and I received an acknowledgement stating that their 'friendly' customer care team would be in contact within 4-working days; no such contact was made.  Three more things to note:  1.  Despite them saying that the quickest way to reach them was via live chat, this function does not work; 2. Their WhatsApp messaging service (which they also recommend) is also 'currently unavailable'; I have now spent over 3-hours in total on the telephone listening to the same drivel message over and over again.  I contacted them via email and received a response stating that 'they would deal with my issue within 5-working-days' and 'not to email again as it clogs up their inbox'.  5-days passed and nothing from Cazoo.  On the sixth day, I received a call stating that the car would be picked up and transported to their Northampton centre; nothing has happened.  It is now 17-days since I initially reported the issue and nothing has happened.  Funnily enough, the 90-day warranty expires next week - I wonder if they are waiting for that so they can absolve themselves of all responsibility; I wouldn't put it past them.  I tried calling the Sales team this morning - amazingly they picked up within 5-seconds.... but when I explained that I was calling about a warranty issue I was told 'that's not my department'.  Cazoo is only interested in taking your money.  Their aftercare service is appalling - almost non-existent.  I'm now having to go down the route of producing a legal challenge, which is going to take even more of my time, but I see no other option as they will not respond to any of my communications nor even attempt to resolve the issue.  I've also now been without a car for three-weeks.  Please, please think twice before buying from Cazoo.

We had already used Carwow to save over ¬£2,500 on the cost of our new vehicle, which was on order for nearly 5 months. At the time we did not ask for a p/x valuation but did once the new vehicles delivery date was known. Their offer was reasonable but did not wow us at all. So we looked to Carwow and were able to easily set the advert, including all the relevant information and a number of pictures of the car. We were then contacted by their support team, where the details were reviewed and they asked us to set a reserve price. I thought I was being a little cheeky in setting the reserve I did but the team told me it was within the range that comparable cars had been sold. This was all done on a Friday evening and we were told the car would be in the auction the next Monday. Email communication was excellent and the car sold for ¬£2,100 more than the p/x quote. Communication from the buying trader was almost instant and a convenient collection time was agreed. The dealer asked for copies of certain documents and Carwow emailed a couple of times to ensure collection process was going to plan. The collection took place perfectly and at the agreed time and we had none of this ""We Buy Any Car"" rubbish where they quote one price and then when you present the car knock you down for anything they can find.

The person that delivered my car was even embarrassed to delivery the vehicle. Took me 6 months to get all my money back, the car spent more time in the garage than i drove it.
